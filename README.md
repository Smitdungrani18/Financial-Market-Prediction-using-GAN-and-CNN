# Financial-Market-Prediction-using-GAN-and-CNN
Deep learning is an incredibly exciting subject that has found applications in various
domains due to its immense potential. One such field where it has gained considerable
traction is finance, which plays a crucial role in society. Financial applications of deep
learning include high-frequency trading, portfolio optimization, fraud detection, and risk
management. Among these, stock market prediction stands out as a widely explored and
valuable area. In this project, we introduce a stock prediction model that leverages the
power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Our model employs Gated Recurrent
Units (GRUs) as a generator, utilizing historical stock prices to generate future stock price
predictions. To distinguish between real and generated stock prices, we employ a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a discriminator. To enhance our predictions, we
introduced some technical indicators and incorporate some features using Fourier
transfer.
